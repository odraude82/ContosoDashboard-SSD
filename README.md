# ContosoDashboard

The ContosoDashboard application is intended for TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY.

The ContosoDashboard repository contains the starter code project for training that teaches Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using the GitHub Spec Kit. ContosoDashboard is a fictional application created solely for educational purposes.

- The project codebase is NOT intended for use in production environments.
- The project architecture is NOT intended as a model for production applications.
- The project is NOT actively maintained and may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.
- The project is provided "as-is" without warranties or support of any kind.
- The project implements mock authentication and authorization for training purposes only.
- The project does NOT implement cloud integration or external service dependencies (local only and offline to maximize training availability).
- The project demonstrates good coding practices, simplified for a training context, with known and documented limitations.

## 🔒 Security Features (Training Implementation)

This application includes a **mock authentication system** designed for training without external dependencies:

- ✅ Cookie-based authentication (8-hour sliding expiration)
- ✅ Claims-based identity with user roles
- ✅ Razor Pages for login/logout (proper HTTP request handling)
- ✅ Custom authentication state provider for Blazor Server integration
- ✅ Authorization enforcement on all protected pages (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- ✅ Service-level security to prevent unauthorized data access
- ✅ IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) protection
- ✅ Defense in depth (middleware, page attributes, service checks)
- ✅ Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- ✅ Cookie security with sliding expiration
- ✅ User isolation - each user sees only their authorized data
- ✅ No external services required (suitable for offline training)

**Note**: The mock authentication is suitable for training only. Production deployments require proper identity providers with password hashing, MFA, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, and compliance with security standards (WCAG 2.1, TLS encryption, audit logging).

### Mock Login System

**Available Users** (no password required - select from dropdown):

| Display Name | Email | Role | Department |
|-------------|-------|------|------------|
| System Administrator | `admin@contoso.com` | Administrator | IT |
| Camille Nicole | `camille.nicole@contoso.com` | Project Manager | Engineering |
| Floris Kregel | `floris.kregel@contoso.com` | Team Lead | Engineering |
| Ni Kang | `ni.kang@contoso.com` | Employee | Engineering |

**Login Process:**

1. Navigate to `/login` (automatic redirect if not authenticated)
2. Select a user from the dropdown
3. Click "Login" - you'll be redirected to the dashboard as that user

⚠️ **Important:** This mock authentication system is for **training only**. Production applications should use Azure AD, Identity Server, Auth0, or similar identity providers with proper password hashing, MFA, and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect.

## Architecture Principles

### Offline-First with Cloud Migration Path

This training application follows an **offline-first architecture** with abstraction layers that enable seamless migration to Azure services:

**Current Implementation (Training/Offline):**
- **Database**: SQLite (offline development database)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem for any file-based features
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based mock authentication

**Production Migration Path:**
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database (replace connection string, no code changes)
- **File Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (swap `IFileStorageService` implementation)
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra ID (replace authentication middleware)

**Key Design Pattern - Infrastructure Abstraction:**

All infrastructure dependencies use **interface abstractions** to enable switching between local and cloud implementations:

```csharp
// Example: File storage abstraction
public interface IFileStorageService
{
    Task<string> UploadAsync(Stream fileStream, string fileName, string contentType);
    Task DeleteAsync(string filePath);
    Task<Stream> DownloadAsync(string filePath);
}

// Training: LocalFileStorageService (uses System.IO)
// Production: AzureBlobStorageService (uses Azure SDK)
// Swap via dependency injection - no business logic changes required
```

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Students learn proper abstraction patterns and dependency injection
- Training works offline without Azure subscriptions or cloud costs
- Migration to production requires only configuration and implementation swaps
- Business logic remains unchanged during cloud migration
- Demonstrates industry-standard separation of concerns

**File upload best practice:** When implementing file uploads, generate unique file paths (using GUID) before database insertion to prevent duplicate key violations and orphaned records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```powershell
   cd ContosoDashboard
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Connection

The default connection string in `appsettings.json` uses SQLite:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
   "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=ContosoDashboard.db"
}
```

The database file is created in the application's working directory when the app starts.

### Production Authentication Guidance

This training application uses mock authentication. For production applications, you would need to:

- Implement proper identity providers (Azure AD, Identity Server, Auth0)
- Add password hashing and salting (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2)
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Implement OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols
- Add rate limiting and account lockout policies
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Use secure session management with idle timeouts
- Implement password complexity requirements and rotation policies

See [Microsoft's ASP.NET Core Security documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/) for production implementation guidance.

### User Roles

The application supports four role levels with hierarchical permissions:

- **Employee**: View and update assigned tasks, view projects where member, manage own profile
- **TeamLead**: All Employee permissions plus view team member activities
- **ProjectManager**: All TeamLead permissions plus create/manage projects, assign tasks
- **Administrator**: Full system access including all administrative functions

## Sample Data

The application includes pre-seeded data for testing:

**Users** (all available for mock login):

- `admin@contoso.com` - System Administrator (Administrator role)
- `camille.nicole@contoso.com` - Camille Nicole (Project Manager role)
- `floris.kregel@contoso.com` - Floris Kregel (Team Lead role)
- `ni.kang@contoso.com` - Ni Kang (Employee role)

**Project**:

- "ContosoDashboard Development" with 3 sample tasks in various states

- Display initials when no photo is set

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Login

- Ensure database is created (run `dotnet run` to auto-create)
- Check that seeded users exist in database
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Redirected to Login After Login

- Check browser cookies are enabled
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private mode

### Can't Access a Page

- Verify you're logged in (user name shown in top-right)
- Check if your role has permission for that resource
- Verify you're a member of the project/task you're trying to access

### Database Issues

**Option 1: Recreate the SQLite database**

```powershell
Remove-Item .\ContosoDashboard.db* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Then run the application - database will be recreated automatically
```

**Option 2: Using EF Tools**

- Delete database: `dotnet ef database drop --force`
- Recreate: Run application (auto-creates with seed data)

**Note**: The application uses `EnsureCreated()` for development, so just running `dotnet run` will automatically create and seed the database if it doesn't exist.

## Security Concepts and Patterns

This training application demonstrates the following security concepts and patterns:

1. **Authentication Patterns** - How to implement and configure authentication
2. **Authorization Enforcement** - Using attributes and policies
3. **Claims-Based Identity** - Working with user claims
4. **IDOR Prevention** - Service-level authorization checks
5. **Security Best Practices** - Defense in depth, least privilege
6. **ASP.NET Core Security** - Industry-standard patterns and middleware

## Known Limitations (Training Context)

This is a **training application**, not production code. Known limitations include:

- **Mock authentication**: No real passwords - anyone can select any user account
- **No rate limiting**: Vulnerable to brute force attacks and denial of service
- **No audit logging**: Security events (login, failed auth, data changes) are not logged
- **Simplified input validation**: Production apps need more comprehensive validation
- **No session timeout warnings**: Users aren't warned before session expiration
- **CSP includes unsafe directives**: `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` required for Blazor Server but not ideal for security
- **No email verification**: User emails are not validated
- **No account lockout**: Failed login attempts don't trigger account locks

These limitations are **intentional** for training purposes to keep the application simple and self-contained. Production applications must address all of these security concerns.

## Code Quality Features

The application demonstrates good coding practices:

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields for performance
- Async/await pattern throughout for non-blocking operations
- Entity Framework Core with eager loading (`.Include()`) to prevent N+1 query problems
- Clean separation of concerns (Models, Services, Data, Pages)
- Dependency injection for loose coupling and testability
